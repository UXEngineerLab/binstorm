# BinStorm
BinStorm is a React Native styling utility for rapidly building custom user interfaces

It is different from frameworks like Shoutem, Native Base, or UI Kitten in that it's not a UI kit.

It doesn't have a default theme, and there are no built-in UI components.

On the flip side, it also has no opinion about how your app should look and doesn't impose design decisions that you have to fight to undo.

If you're looking for a framework that comes with a menu of predesigned widgets to build your app with, BinStorm might not be the right framework for you.

But if you want a huge head start implementing a custom design with its own identity, BinStorm might be just what you're looking for.
